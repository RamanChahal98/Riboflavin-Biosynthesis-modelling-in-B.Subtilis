# Riboflavin-Biosynthesis-modelling-in-B.Subtilis
Dynamic Modelling - Antimony.py
To follow the changes of riboflavin production in B.Subtilis over time a dynamic model of riboflavin synthesis in B. Subtilis was produced using Antimony (Spyder for
Tellurium 3.6), consisting of an ODE system following the law of mass action (Aronson JK, et al., 2016). 

RuleBased Modelling - Rulebender.bngl
A rule-based model of riboflavin production in B.Subtilis was created using BioNetGen language (BNGL) in RuleBender.

Flux Balance Analysis - FluxBalanceAnalysis.XML
Flux balance analysis was performed in OptFlux using the Michaelis-Menten enzymic reactions 1-7 SBML model.
